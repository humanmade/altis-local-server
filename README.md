## Local Server

A local development environment for Altis projects, built on Docker.

## Dependencies

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (you can [install Docker Machine directly](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) if preferred)

## Installation with Altis

Altis Local Server is included by default in an Altis project, so you don't need to install anything else.

## Installation without Altis

Altis Local Server can be installed as a dependency within a Composer-based WordPress project:

```sh
$ composer require --dev altis/local-server
```

Please note that non-Altis installation is not officially supported, and is made available on an as-is basis.

## Getting Started

In your Altis project you can run the following commands:

```sh
# Start the server cluster
composer server start

# Stop the server cluster
composer server stop
```
